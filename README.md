this took me longer than it should have ðŸ’€
its ok though, to use just do
/si save (name)
/si remove (name)
/si load (name)

/si load will organize you inventory based off of your saved inventory of your choice, and when you /si save it just takes your current inventory

this is inspired by Client Kits, and its pretty similar probably (i didnt check the code, i probably should have now i think of it but i mean that the idea is similar)
